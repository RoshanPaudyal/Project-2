Reasons for creating trading bot:

1. Efficiency: Algorithmic trading bots can execute trades much faster than human traders can, and they can do so with minimal errors. This is because they operate on pre-defined sets of rules and conditions, and can process large amounts of data in a short amount of time.

2. Emotion-free trading: Humans are prone to emotions such as fear and greed, which can influence their trading decisions. Algorithmic bots, on the other hand, are completely emotion-free and can execute trades based solely on pre-defined rules and conditions. This can help eliminate some of the biases and mistakes that human traders are prone to.

3. 24/7 trading: Algorithmic trading bots can be programmed to operate 24/7, allowing for trades to be executed even when the trader is asleep or otherwise unavailable. This can help take advantage of trading opportunities that may arise outside of regular trading hours.

4. Backtesting and optimization: Algorithmic trading bots can be backtested on historical data to see how they would have performed in the past. This can help traders optimize their strategies and improve their overall performance.

5. Diversification: Algorithmic trading bots can help traders diversify their portfolio by allowing them to execute trades across multiple assets and markets simultaneously. This can help reduce risk and increase overall returns.
